/**
 * S2Builder is a tool for assembling geometry from edges. Here are some of the things it is
 * designed for:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Building polygons, polylines, and polygon meshes from unsorted collections of edges.
 *   <li>Snapping geometry to discrete representations (such as S2CellId centers or E7 lat/lng
 *       coordinates) while preserving the input topology and with guaranteed error bounds.
 *   <li>Simplifying geometry (e.g. for indexing, display, or storage).
 *   <li>Importing geometry from other formats, including repairing geometry that has errors.
 *   <li>As a tool for implementing more complex operations such as polygon intersections and
 *       unions.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The implementation is based on the framework of "snap rounding". Unlike most snap rounding
 * implementations, S2Builder defines edges as geodesics on the sphere (straight lines) and uses the
 * topology of the sphere (i.e., there are no "seams" at the poles or 180th meridian). The algorithm
 * is designed to be 100% robust for arbitrary input geometry. It offers the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Guaranteed bounds on how far input vertices and edges can move during the snapping process
 *       (i.e., at most the given "snapRadius").
 *   <li>Guaranteed minimum separation between edges and vertices other than their endpoints
 *       (similar to the goals of Iterated Snap Rounding). In other words, edges that do not
 *       intersect in the output are guaranteed to have a minimum separation between them.
 *   <li>Idempotency (similar to the goals of Stable Snap Rounding), i.e. if the input already meets
 *       the output criteria then it will not be modified.
 *   <li>Preservation of the input topology (up to the creation of degeneracies). This means that
 *       there exists a continuous deformation from the input to the output such that no vertex
 *       crosses an edge. In other words, self-intersections won't be created, loops won't change
 *       orientation, etc.
 *   <li>The ability to snap to arbitrary discrete point sets (such as S2CellId centers, E7 lat/lng
 *       points on the sphere, or simply a subset of the input vertices), rather than being limited
 *       to an integer grid.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Here are some of its other features:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It can handle both directed and undirected edges. Undirected edges can be useful for
 *       importing data from other formats, e.g. where loops have unspecified orientations.
 *   <li>It can eliminate self-intersections by finding all edge pairs that cross and adding a new
 *       vertex at each intersection point.
 *   <li>It can simplify polygons to within a specified tolerance. For example, if two vertices are
 *       close enough they will be merged, and if an edge passes nearby a vertex then it will be
 *       rerouted through that vertex. Optionally, it can also detect nearly straight chains of
 *       short edges and replace them with a single long edge, while maintaining the same accuracy,
 *       separation, and topology guarantees ("simplifyEdgeChains").
 *   <li>It supports many different output types through the concept of "layers" (polylines,
 *       polygons, polygon meshes, etc.) You can build multiple layers at once in order to ensure
 *       that snapping does not create intersections between different objects (for example, you can
 *       simplify a set of contour lines without the risk of having them cross each other).
 *   <li>It supports edge labels, which allow you to attach arbitrary information to edges and have
 *       it preserved during the snapping process. (This can also be achieved using layers, at a
 *       coarser level of granularity.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Every edge can have a set of non-negative integer labels attached to it, assigned when the
 * edge (or shape) is added to the builder. When used with an appropriate layer type, you can then
 * retrieve the labels associated with each output edge. This can be useful when merging or
 * combining data from several sources. (Note that in many cases it is easier to use separate output
 * layers rather than labels.)
 *
 * <p>Labels are 32-bit non-negative integers. To support other label types, you can use
 * ValueLexicon to store the set of unique labels seen so far:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 *   ValueLexicon<MyLabelType> myLabelLexicon = new ValueLexicon<>();
 *   builder.setLabel(myLabelLexicon.add(label));
 * }
 *
 * <p>The current set of labels is represented as a stack. This makes it easy to add and remove
 * labels hierarchically (e.g., polygon 5, loop 2). Use setLabel() and clearLabels() if you need at
 * most one label per edge.
 *
 * <p>Caveat: Because S2Builder only works with edges, it cannot distinguish between the empty and
 * full polygons. If your application can generate both the empty and full polygons, you must
 * implement logic outside of this class.
 *
 * <p>Example showing how to snap a polygon to E7 coordinates:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * S2Polygon inputPolygon = ...;
 * S2Error error = new S2Error();
 *
 * // Create a builder with a SnapFunction for E7, and a polygon layer.
 * S2Builder builder = new S2Builder.Builder(new IntLatLngSnapFunction(7)).build();
 * S2PolygonLayer layer = new S2BuilderUtil.S2PolygonLayer();
 * builder.startLayer(layer);
 *
 * // Add the input polygon to the builder and build. Check that the build was successful.
 * builder.addPolygon(inputPolygon);
 * if (!builder.build(error)) {
 *   logger.atError().log(error.text());
 *    ...
 *  }
 * }</pre>

   * currently requires that input vertices be sorted so that equal vertices are adjacent.
   *
   * <p>For {@link #chooseInitialSites}, any sort order would produce correct output, so we have
   * complete flexibility in choosing the sort key. We could even leave them unsorted, although this
   * would have the disadvantage that changing the order of the input edges could cause S2Builder to
   * snap to a different set of Voronoi sites.
   *
   * <p>We have chosen to sort them primarily by S2CellId since this improves the performance of
   * many S2Builder phases (due to better spatial locality). It also allows the possibility of
   * replacing the current S2PointIndex approach with a more efficient recursive divide-and-conquer
   * algorithm.
   *
   * <p>However, sorting by leaf S2CellId alone has two small disadvantages in the case where the
   * candidate sites are densely spaced relative to the snap radius (e.g., when using the
   * IdentitySnapFunction, or when snapping to E6/E7 near the poles, or snapping to S2CellId/E6/E7
   * using a snap radius larger than the minimum value required):
   *
   * <p>First, it tends to bias the Voronoi site locations towards points that are earlier on the
   * S2CellId Hilbert curve. For example, suppose that there are two parallel rows of input vertices
   * on opposite sides of the edge between two large S2Cells, and the rows are separated by less
   * than the snap radius. Then only vertices from the cell with the smaller S2CellId are selected,
   * because they are considered first and prevent us from selecting the sites from the other cell
   * (because they are closer than "snapRadius" to an existing site).
   *
   * <p>Second, it tends to choose more Voronoi sites than necessary, because at each step we choose
   * the first site along the Hilbert curve that is at least "snapRadius" away from all previously
   * selected sites. This tends to yield sites whose "coverage discs" overlap quite a bit, whereas
   * it would be better to cover all the input vertices with a smaller set of coverage discs that
   * don't overlap as much. (This is the "geometric set cover problem", which is NP-hard.)
   *
   * <p>It is not worth going to much trouble to fix these problems, because they really aren't that
   * important (and don't affect the guarantees made by the algorithm), but here are a couple of
   * heuristics that might help:
   *
   * <p>1. Sort the input vertices by S2CellId at a coarse level (down to cells that are
   * O(snapRadius) in size), and then sort by a fingerprint of the S2Point coordinates (i.e., quasi-
   * randomly). This would retain most of the advantages of S2CellId sorting, but makes it more
   * likely that we will select sites that are further apart.
   *
   * <p>2. Rather than choosing the first uncovered input vertex and snapping it to obtain the next
   * Voronoi site, instead look ahead through following candidates in S2CellId order and choose the
   * furthest candidate whose snapped location covers all previous uncovered input vertices.

   * of SnapFunctions may assume they are immutable, and have undefined behavior if they are changed
   * while being used.
   *
   * <p>A SnapFunction defines the following methods:
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>The snapPoint() method, which snaps a point P to a nearby point (the "candidate snap
   *       site"). Any point may be returned, including P itself (this is the "identity snap
   *       function").
   *   <li>snapRadius(), the maximum distance that vertices can move when snapped. The snapRadius
   *       must be at least as large as the maximum distance between P and snapPoint(P) for any
   *       point P.
   *       <p>Note that the maximum distance that edge interiors can move when snapped is slightly
   *       larger than "snapRadius", and is returned by the function {@link
   *       Builder#maxEdgeDeviation()} (see there for details).
   *   <li>minVertexSeparation(), the guaranteed minimum distance between vertices in the output.
   *       This is generally a fraction of "snapRadius" where the fraction depends on the snap
   *       function.
   *   <li>minEdgeVertexSeparation(), the guaranteed minimum distance between edges and non-incident
   *       vertices in the output. This is generally a fraction of "snapRadius" where the fraction
   *       depends on the snap function.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p>It is important to note that snapPoint() does not define the actual mapping from input
   * vertices to output vertices, since the points it returns (the candidate snap sites) are further
   * filtered to ensure that they are separated by at least the snap radius. For example, if you
   * specify E7 coordinates (2cm resolution) and a snap radius of 10m, then a subset of points
   * returned by SnapPoint will be chosen (the "snap sites"), and each input vertex will be mapped
   * to the closest site. Therefore you cannot assume that P is necessarily snapped to snapPoint(P).

   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>Every vertex is at a location returned by snapPoint().
   *   <li>Vertices are within "snapRadius" of the corresponding input vertex.
   *   <li>Edges are within "maxEdgeDeviation" of the corresponding input edge (a distance slightly
   *       larger than "snapRadius").
   *   <li>Vertices are separated by at least "minVertexSeparation" (a fraction of "snapRadius" that
   *       depends on the snap function).
   *   <li>Edges and non-incident vertices are separated by at least "minEdgeVertexSeparation" (a
   *       fraction of "snapRadius").
   *   <li>Vertex and edge locations do not change unless one of the conditions above is not already
   *       met (idempotency / stability).
   *   <li>The topology of the input geometry is preserved (up to the creation of degeneracies).
