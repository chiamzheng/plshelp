/**
 * A clipper of shape edges to rectangular regions in UV space. Layered over R2EdgeClipper,
 * providing UV specific semantics and error bounds. UVEdgeClipper isn't cell specific. It can clip
 * to any rectangular region in UV space, set via calling {@link #init(int, R2Rect)} or the
 * equivalent constructor before clipping edges. Since clipping to {@link S2Cell} boundaries is the
 * most common use of this class, we provide a convenience method {@link #init(S2Cell)} and
 * equivalent constructor which set the face and clip rect from the cell.
 *
 * <p>UVEdgeClipper does not clip exactly or use exact tests to determine boundary crossings, so it
 * is possible for points very close to the boundary to falsely test as crossing. We include an
 * error bound when reporting UV edges so that care can be taken in those cases.
 *
 * <p>Example usage (given some S2Cell 'cell' and an {@code S2Point[2]} edge:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * UVEdgeClipper clipper = new UVEdgeClipper();
 *
 * clipper.init(cell);
 * if (clipper.clipEdge(edge[0], edge[1])) {
 *   if (clipper.outcode(0) == LEFT) {
 *     System.out.println("The first vertex landed on the left boundary!");
 *   }
 * }
 * }
 *
 * <p>The clipEdge method returns true if the edge intersected the clip face and clip region, false
 * otherwise. When the edge misses, the {@link #missedFace()} method can be used to distinguish
 * whether the edge missed the clip face entirely, or hit the face but missed the clip region.
 *
 * <p>The clipper also provides the following information after clipping an edge:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 *   faceUvEdge(): The UV coordinates of the edge after being clipped to the clip face, but before
 *     being clipped to the clip region.
 *
 *   clippedUvEdge(): the UV coordinates of the edge after being clipped to the clip face and then
 *     the clip region.
 *
 *    outcode(): A simple (single bit set) outcode for each vertex indicating which edge of the
 *      region it was clipped to (i.e. which boundary segment it landed on). If the vertex landed
 *      inside the clip region to begin with, this will be Outcode.INSIDE. If the edge doesn't
 *      intersect the clip region (including missing the face), this will be Outcode.OUTSIDE.
 *
 *   uvError(): The maximum absolute error incurred converting to UV coordinates and possibly
 *     clipping the edge to the clip face. If no face clipping is performed, this is just the
 *     XYZ => UV conversion error. This is the maximum absolute error in each of the U and V
 *     components of the vertices of faceUvEdge().
 *
 *   clipError(): The maximum absolute error in a clipped vertex. This necessarily includes
 *     uvError() since we always have to convert the input edge to UV coordinates and also includes
 *     any error incurred when interpolating to find the intersection point on a region boundary.
 *     This is the maximum absolute error in each of the U and V components of the vertices of
 *     clippedUvEdge().
 *
 * The information available depends on the result status:
 *
 *   hit?   missedFace?  faceUvEdge  clippedUvEdge  outcode  uvError  clipError
 *   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   false   true         NO          NO            YES      YES      YES
 *   false  false        YES          NO            YES      YES      YES
 *    true  -----        YES         YES            YES      YES      YES
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>We treat the clip region as a closed set (i.e. points on the boundary test as contained).
 * Given an Edge E, and a clip region R, we ensure the following properties hold:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>If a vertex of E is contained in R, then that vertex is left unmodified.
 *   <li>If E doesn't intersect R at all then it's left unmodified.
 *   <li>Otherwise E is clipped so that each vertex that falls outside of R is moved onto one of the
 *       four boundary segments _exactly_. I.e. at least one component (U or V) of the clipped
 *       vertex will _equal_ a boundary coordinate. Intersection points near corners may fall
 *       outside the actual clip region due to numerical error.
 *   <li>If an edge crosses a boundary segment S that is the same between two different clip regions
 *       R and Q, then clipping the edge against R or against Q yields the _exact_ same result,
 *       which is the intersection point on S.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>We use the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm which classifies each endpoint of an edge by which
 * region it falls into relative to the clip region: top, bottom, left and right. Points that fall
 * into one of the corner regions are tagged as being in both of the regions that overlap it (e.g.
 * top-left).
 *
 * <p>We take the convention that left and right regions partition the U axis and the top and bottom
 * regions partition the V axis:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * Left       Right
 *
 *   TL │ T │ TR     Top
 *  ────┼───┼────  ^
 *    L │ I │ R    | v
 *  ────┼───┼────  |
 *   BL │ B │ BR    Bottom
 *
 *      ---->
 *        u
 * }
 *
 * <p>We then clip line segments (edges) based on which region its endpoints landed in. In the worst
 * case, we have to perform 4 clipping operations to fully clip the endpoints, though we take steps
 * to amortize this cost.
 *
 * <p>Cohen-Sutherland is ~3-4x faster than {@link S2EdgeUtil#clipEdge}, for several reasons:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>It can quickly accept and reject edges that don't cross the clipping region
 *   <li>It can re-use information from a previous connected edge to speed up clipping
 *   <li>The clipped results are easier to use since they will exactly intersect the clipping
 *       boundary
 * </ol>
