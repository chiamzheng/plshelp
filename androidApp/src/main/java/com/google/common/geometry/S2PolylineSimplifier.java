/**
 * This is a helper class for simplifying polylines. It allows you to compute a maximal edge that
 * intersects a sequence of discs, and that optionally avoids a different sequence of discs. The
 * results are conservative in that the edge is guaranteed to intersect or avoid the specified discs
 * using exact arithmetic (see S2Predicates.java).
 *
 * <p>Note that S2Builder can also simplify polylines and supports more features (e.g., snapping to
 * S2CellId centers), so it is only recommended to use this class if S2Builder does not meet your
 * needs.
 *
 * <p>Here is a simple example showing how to simplify a polyline into a sequence of edges that stay
 * within "maxError" of the original edges:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * List<S2Point> v = { ... };
 * S2PolylineSimplifier simplifier = new S2PolylineSimplifier();
 * simplifier.init(v.get(0));
 * for (int i = 1; i < v.size(); ++i) {
 *   if (!simplifier.extend(v.get(i))) {
 *     outputEdge(simplifier.src(), v.get(i - 1));
 *     simplifier.init(v.get(i - 1));
 *   }
 *   simplifier.targetDisc(v.get(i), maxError);
 * }
 * outputEdge(simplifer.src(), v.back());
 *
 * }
 *
 * <p>Note that the points targeted by targetDisc do not need to be the same as the candidate
 * endpoints passed to extend(). So for example, you could target the original vertices of a
 * polyline, but only consider endpoints that are snapped to E7 coordinates or S2CellId centers.
 *
 * <p>Please be aware that this class works by maintaining a range of acceptable angles (bearings)
 * from the start vertex to the hypothetical destination vertex. It does not keep track of distances
 * to any of the discs to be targeted or avoided. Therefore to use this class correctly, constraints
 * should be added in increasing order of distance. (The actual requirement is slightly weaker than
 * this, which is why it is not enforced, but basically you should only call targetDisc() and
 * avoidDisc() with arguments that you want to constrain the immediately following call to
 * extend().)
