/**
 * A class for tracking a shape in an S2ShapeIndex and detecting when all the pieces of the shape
 * have been visited.
 *
 * <p>This works by tracking segments of S2Cell boundaries in IJ coordinates that are contained by a
 * shape. These segments must always match up across cell boundaries. By "toggling" segments on and
 * off as we visit them, we can arrange for them all to cancel once we have seen all the interior
 * pieces of a shape.
 *
 * <p>Once we have seen every chain at least once, and there are no outstanding boundary segments
 * contained by the shape, then we have visited all of the shape.
 *
 * <p>1. Usage
 *
 * <pre>
 * Instantiate an S2ShapeTracker instance and initialize it with an S2Shape:
 * {@code
 *   S2ShapeTracker tracker = new S2ShapeTracker(shape);
 * } or {@code
 *   tracker.reset(shape);
 * }
 *
 * Then, as you iterate through an index, mark individual chains as seen when you come across them:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * tracker.markChain(chain);
 * }
 *
 * This method is cheap to call (O(1) complexity) and idempotent so it's safe to call multiple times
 * per chain.
 *
 * <p>Use S2RobustCellClipper to generate boundary crossings for the current cell and process them
 * with shape tracker:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * S2RobustCellClipper clipper = new S2RobustCellClipper();
 *
 * clipper.startCell(cell);
 * for (each edge from shape in cell) {
 *   clipper.clipEdge(edge);
 * }
 *
 * tracker.processCrossings(cell, clipper.getCrossings());
 * }
 *
 * <p>If the cell has no edges but is contained by the shape, use addCellBoundary() to account for
 * the entire boundary of the cell in the tracker:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * tracker.addCellBoundary(cell);
 * }
 *
 * The current of the shape can be queried via the finished() method:
 *
 * {@snippet :
 * if (tracker.finished()) {
 *   ... report results
 * }
 * }
 *
 * <p>The tracker can then be reused for a new shape by calling reset().
 *
 * <p>The rest of this documentation covers the theory and details behind interior tracking. If you
 * just want to get started tracking shapes, feel free to skip.
 *
 * <p>2. Theory
 *
 * <p>For bulk queries in general, and containment in particular, we need to know when we've seen
 * all of a shape so that we know when it's safe to make a final decision regarding the shape and
 * return results to the user.
 *
 * <p>Since shape edges can span multiple cells, it's not sufficient to just track that we've seen
 * all the edges in a shape. If we imagine a shape with one long edge that crosses many cells, the
 * first cell we visit we will mark the edge as seen and report results. But the edge continued
 * outside the cell and we may have missed information relevant to the query result.
 *
 * <p>The same reasoning applies to 2D shapes. Imagine a ring circling the Earth around the equator.
 * If we create another shape by reversing the order of the first, the two shapes won't be contained
 * even though they have the same exact vertices. The interior of each escapes the interior of the
 * other.
 *
 * <p>But, importantly, we have no way to know this directly, since all the vertices are coincident,
 * none of the vertices will test as outside the shapes nor will edges cross.
 *
 * <p>This interior "escapage" is only detectable by knowing that there is "more interior" pending
 * when we finish processing all the edges.
 *
 * <p>By tracking portions of the cell boundary that are contained by a shape and removing them when
 * we visit the opposite side of the boundary, we can track what pieces of a shape are still
 * unresolved.
 *
 * <p>Multi-points are trivial, they can't cross a cell boundary (or any edge) and are each their
 * own chain so we merely have to check that we've seen all the chains in the shape.
 *
 * <p>Polylines are slightly more complex because they can cross a boundary at a point. These
 * crossings are 0 dimensional however so we only have to match crossings and don't have to worry
 * about extents.
 *
 * <p>Finally, polygons can contain a 1 dimensional segment of the cell boundary, so we have to
 * track both the presence of a crossing and its extent.
 *
 * <p>It's entirely legitimate (and common) for us to have a large cell bounded by smaller ones, so
 * we may see a segment of a boundary that is then visited on its opposite side in smaller pieces
 * (or vice-versa):
 *
 * <pre>
 *             ┌─────┬─┐     ┌───────┐     ┌───────┐    ┌───────┐
 *             │     ├─┘  →  │     ┌─┤  →  │       │ →  │       │
 *             │     │       │     ├─┘     │     ┌─┤    │       │
 *             └─────┘       └─────┘       └─────┴─┘    └───────┘
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Thus, we need a way to track boundary intervals that also allows us to build and cancel in
 * small pieces. We can't merely store an interval (A,B) and expect to cancel it in a single piece
 * with another interval (B,A).
 *
 * <p>2.1 The Problem
 *
 * <p>Given a grid of non-overlapping cells (which any S2ShapeIndex is), we'd like to devise a
 * system where we can track boundary segments efficiently. We know a few things that we can use to
 * our advantage:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>If we're destined to see all of a shape, then any time it crosses a cell boundary, we will
 *       always see both sides of the boundary due to the cell padding we use when building indices.
 *   <li>We will always see exactly the same crossing points in cells on either side of the boundary
 *       due to the exactness in UVEdgeClipper.
 *   <li>In IJ space, cells become axis-aligned squares with their boundary segments lying along
 *       constant I or J values.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Since we can rely on seeing the same section of cell boundary twice the problem is one of
 * pairing and canceling matching segments.
 *
 * <p>2.2 The Closure Grid
 *
 * <p>Towards this goal, let's note that that we can build a consistent notion of sign along cell
 * boundaries. By consistent, we mean that we can assign every boundary segment of every S2 cell a
 * sign value (either +1 or -1) that is opposite across the boundary.
 *
 * <p>Cells have consistently numbered edges, ordered CCW around the boundary, numbered 0 to 3. If
 * we define edges 0 and 1 to be positive and edges 2 and 3 to be negative, then we can see that if
 * we tesselate the cells the sign values are equal-and-opposite across boundaries:
 *
 * <pre>

 *
 * <p>Because cell orientations on a given face are constant, this holds true even when there are
 * cells of different sizes on each side of the boundary. One side will always have the positive
 * boundaries and the other side the negative.
 *
 * <p>This works automatically within a given face, but is it also true between faces? The naive
 * answer is "almost". Let's look at the face cells with sign values assigned as described above:
 *

 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Touching face edges that have the same sign (and are thus incompatible) are connected by
 * lines. Interestingly all the "interior" face boundaries in the diagram are consistent.
 *
 * <p>The edge of a face at a maximum IJ coordinate (S2Projections.LIMIT_IJ == 2^30) spatially
 * aliases the edge of the adjacent face at value 0. We need to break this tie so that intervals
 * along the boundaries between faces are canceled properly.
 *
 * <p>The exact choice in breaking ties doesn't matter as long as it's consistent, so we take the
 * convention that maximum values alias back down to the minimum value on the adjacent face and we
 * do our interval accounting there. This fits nicely with the mental model of faces being "half
 * open" and not containing their upper boundaries.
 *
 * <p>As an example, the maximum J coordinate on face 0 ends up being stored using the minimum I
 * coordinate of face 2, and we flip the values of the intervals so that they match the coordinate
 * system on face two.
 *
 * <p>Looking at the diagram above, all of our incompatible face edges are at a maximum J value.
 * Since we have to wrap those boundaries anyways, while we're doing that, we can negate the sign as
 * well and we now have a fully consistent signed boundary system.
 *
 * <p>2.3 Summing Interval Lengths
 *
 * <p>Now that we have a sign convention that naturally cancels across boundaries, we could track
 * polygon closure by finding segments of the grid that are contained (by finding cell boundary
 * crossings), and summing their lengths with appropriate signs. Since we'll see both sides of a
 * boundary, we'll always add a given length and subtract it out later. The lengths naturally
 * cancel.
 *
 * <p>To do this, take a section of boundary that contains one or more crossings:
 *
 * <pre>
 *                                    ←
 *        •────────•━━━━•───────────•━━━━•─────────────•━━━━━━━━━━━━•
 *        X        A    B           C    D             E            Y
 *                                    →
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>When we're traversing left-to-right, the first contained interval we'll see is (A,B). (B,C) is
 * not contained so we ignore it, then we take (C,D) and (E,Y).
 *
 * <p>We'll maintain a sum, and for each contained interval we'll add the first point and subtract
 * the second point:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    sum += A-B + C-D + E-Y
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Now, when we traverse the opposite side, we'll proceed right-to-left, and we'll see the
 * intervals with their vertices swapped: (Y,E), (D,C), and (B,A).
 *
 * <p>We'll still add the first, and subtract the second:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   sum += Y-E + D-C + B-A
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If we look at this together with the first sum:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   sum = A-B + C-D + E-Y + Y-E + D-C + B-A = 0
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Each crossing point has been canceled out exactly, leaving a zero total.
 *
 * <p>Note that this left-to-right and right-to-left ordering is a natural consequence of cells all
 * being CCW oriented. Cells with adjacent boundaries will traverse that boundary in opposite
 * directions:
 *
 * <pre>
 *                             ┌───────┬───────┐
 *                             │   ←   │   ←   │
 *                             │↓     ↑│↓     ↑│
 *                             │   →   │   →   │
 *                             ├───────┼───────┤
 *                             │   ←   │   ←   │
 *                             │↓     ↑│↓     ↑│
 *                             │   →   │   →   │
 *                             └───────┴───────┘
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This summation also works naturally for splitting up larger intervals, imagine a large cell
 * with a piece of its boundary contained, bordered by smaller cells:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 *      smaller cells │   0    │    1   │    2   │    3
 *                    │   →    B    →   C    →   D    →   │
 *                    ├─────•━━┷━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━┷━━━━•───┤
 *      large cell    │     X           ←             Y   │
 * </pre>
 *
 * Moving right-to-left first, we'll add (Y,X) first:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   total = Y-X
 * </pre>
 *
 * Now, we process left-to-right (we can process the cells in any order, let's assume 1,2,0,3):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   cell1 - total = Y-X + B-C
 *   cell2 - total = Y-X + B-C + C-D = Y-X + B-D
 *   cell0 - total = Y-X + B-D + X-B = Y-D
 *   cell3 - total = Y-D + D-Y = 0
 * </pre>
 *
 * The values close, and the same is true in any order, let's do 3,2,1,0:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   cell3 - total = Y-X + D-Y = D-X
 *   cell2 - total = D-X + C-D = C-X
 *   cell1 - total = C-X + B-C = B-X
 *   cell0 - total = B-X + X-B = 0
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In this example we can see more clearly how we "cancel" pieces of the Y-X interval one at a
 * time, but we're always left with the remaining interval.
 *
 * <p>2.3.1 General Iteration Order Safety
 *
 * <p>The attentive reader might worry that we might accidentally have a crossing of, say, length 2,
 * and pair it with two unrelated length 1 crossings on the other side of the boundary, and get a
 * net zero without actually closing all the intervals. We need to ensure we can't get a false
 * positive for a given shape.
 *
 * <p>First, let's assume all of our points are distinct. This is easy enough to arrange in IJ
 * coordinates, since (face, i, j) specifies a unique point, and cells that are used in an
 * S2ShapeIndex do not overlap.
 *
 * <p>If we look at a closure sum:
 *
 * <pre>
 * (A-B) + (B-C) + (C-A) = 0
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Note the general pattern is that we add an element, and then eventually subtract its exact
 * value again to cancel it out. If our points are distinct, we don't have to rely on actually
 * summing them together, we can just track which points we've accumulated with a set, inserting and
 * removing them as we go.
 *
 * <p>We can implicitly track an IJ interval (A,B) by storing its endpoints.
 *
 * <p>It's possible to see multiple of the same point, e.g. if you had multiple crossings within the
 * same IJ coordinate. To support this, we'll use a hashmap of points mapping to a count.
 *
 * <p>Our final method for tracking closure becomes simply:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   hashmap[point]++
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>And subtracting a point:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   hashmap[point]--
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>With zero being the default value for a new entry. If the count goes to zero in either case,
 * we remove the point. When the set is empty, we have an exact closure.
 *
 * <p>2.4 Rounding intervals
 *
 * <p>We have to be careful with very small crossings. It's entirely possible for a shape to cross a
 * cell boundary with a width less than one unit in IJ space:
 *
 * <pre>
 *            ╲    ╱
 *     ┌─────┬─•  •┬─────┬─────┐
 *              ╲╱
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If we round these intervals naively, we can end up with a zero-length interval in IJ space
 * with equal endpoints. That would result in an interval (A,A) which we would add as A-A = 0, which
 * wouldn't contribute to the tracking information.
 *
 * <p>We can resolve this by rounding intervals _outwards_. We'll round the lower endpoint down, and
 * the higher endpoint up:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     ┌─────┬─• •─┬─────┬─────┐
 *            ←   →
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This will give always give us an interval that's at least one unit length, and it works
 * consistently across T points and corners, so that they will properly close:
 *
 * <pre>
 *         │   \   /   │       │   ←  →    │      │    ___    │
 *         ├────•╷•────┤   →   ├────•╷•────┤  →   ├─────┬─────┤
 *         │     │     │       │   ← │→    │      │    ‾│‾    │
 * </pre>
