/**
 * S2ChainInterpolationQuery is a helper class for querying points along an S2Shape's edges (chains
 * of vertices) by spherical angular distances. The distance, measured in radians, is computed by
 * accumulating the lengths of the edges of the shape, in the order the edges are stored by the
 * S2Shape object.
 *
 * <p>If a particular edge chain is specified at the query initialization, then the distances are
 * along that single chain, which allows per-chain operations. If no chain is specified, then the
 * interpolated points as a function of distance will have discontinuities at chain boundaries. This
 * makes it easier to implement some algorithms, such as random sampling along the total length of a
 * multiline.
 *
 * <p>Once the query object is initialized, the complexity of each subsequent query is O(log(m)),
 * where m is the number of edges. The complexity of the constructor and the memory footprint of the
 * query object are both O(m).
